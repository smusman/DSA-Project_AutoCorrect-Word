# DSA-Project_AutoCorrect-Word

This is my 4th Semester Project for the Course Data Structures and Algorithms. 

## Description
Auto-Correct / Auto-Complete Program is the most widely used feature right. Whether it is your smartphones, or any word processing software, it has nowadays become a must to include this feature. This project is about to write a program that creates this feature and uses the most suitable and efficient Data structure to make is possible.

## Sample Working

Word entered: teh

Output:  Did you mean ‘the’?

Word entered: hel

Output: Did you mean ‘hell’ or ‘hello’?
